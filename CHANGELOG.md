# Changelog

Both client libraries are pre-1.0, and they have separate versioning.

## Unreleased

- All Go SDK functions that take a Context will respect the timeout of the context.
- Improved the error message when calling a webhook Function as a normal Function.
- Allow customizing the config file path via `MODAL_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable (defaults to `~/.modal.toml`).

## modal-js/v0.5.0, modal-go/v0.5.0

The first beta release of the Modal SDKs for JS and Go (graduating from alpha). See the [Migration Guide](./MIGRATION-GUIDE.md) for a detailed list of breaking changes.

- The SDKs now expose a central Modal Client object as the main entry point for interacting with Modal resources.
- The interface for working with Modal object instances (Functions, Sandboxes, Images, etc.) is largely the same as before, with some naming changes.
- Calling deployed Functions and classes now uses a new protocol for payload serialization which requires the deployed apps to use the Modal Python SDK 1.2 or newer.
- Internally removed the global client (and config/profile data in global scope), moving all that to the Client type.
- Consistent parameter naming across both SDKs: all `Options` structs/interfaces renamed to `Params`.
- JS-specific changes:
  - Added explicit unit suffixes to all parameters that represent durations (in milliseconds, suffixed with `Ms`) or memory amounts (in MiB, suffixed with `MiB`).
- Go-specific changes:
  - Changed how we do context passing, so contexts now only affect the current operation and are not used for lifecycle management of the created resources.
  - All `Params` structs are now passed as pointers for consistency and to support optional parameters.
  - Field names follow Go casing conventions (e.g., `Id` → `ID`, `Url` → `URL`, `TokenId` → `TokenID`).
  - Added explicit unit suffixes to all parameters that represent memory amounts (in MiB, suffixed with `MiB`).

Additional new features:
- Added support for setting CPU and memory limits when creating Sandboxes and Cls instances.

## modal-js/v0.3.25, modal-go/v0.0.25

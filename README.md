This repo hosts the [Modal](https://modal.com) SDKs for JavaScript/TypeScript and Go. They provide convenient, on-demand access to serverless cloud compute on Modal from JS/TS and golang projects. Use it to safely run arbitrary code in Modal Sandboxes, call Modal Functions, and interact with Modal resources. For Python, see the main [Modal Python SDK](https://github.com/modal-labs/modal-client) instead.

For more details, documentation and installation instructions, see the README for each SDK:
- **[JavaScript / TypeScript](./modal-js/README.md)**
- **[Go](./modal-go/README.md)**

## Support

For usage questions and other support, please reach out on the [Modal Community Slack](https://modal.com/slack).

## Community SDKs

There are also open-source Modal libraries built and maintained by our community. These projects are not officially supported by Modal and we thus can't vouch for them, but feel free to explore and contribute.
